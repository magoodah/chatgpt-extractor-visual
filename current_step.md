⏺ 🧪 Node Accessibility Enhancement Ready for Testing

  I've implemented the hover expansion solution for dense cluster accessibility:

  🎯 How It Works:

  1. Density Detection: Automatically detects when 3+ nodes are within 80px radius with overlapping positions (<50px apart)
  2. Hover Expansion: When hovering over dense areas:
    - Cursor changes to crosshair (visual feedback)
    - Dashed blue circle appears showing expansion area
    - Outward forces push nodes apart temporarily
    - Individual nodes become accessible for clicking
  3. Automatic Restoration: When mouse leaves dense area:
    - Expansion forces stop
    - Nodes return to natural clustering positions
    - Normal cursor and interactions resume

  🔧 Technical Implementation:

  - Smart Detection: Only activates in truly dense areas (2+ overlapping pairs)
  - Gentle Forces: 0.3 strength expansion that doesn't break clustering
  - Visual Feedback: Dashed circle shows expansion radius
  - Performance: Minimal overhead, only processes nearby nodes

  📋 Testing Instructions:

  1. Refresh constellation.html
  2. Wait for dense clusters to form (20+ nodes)
  3. Hover over crowded areas where nodes overlap
  4. Look for:
    - ✅ Crosshair cursor appears
    - ✅ Dashed blue circle shows expansion area
    - ✅ Nodes spread apart gently
    - ✅ Individual nodes become clickable
    - ✅ Nodes return to clusters when mouse leaves

  Expected Outcome: You should be able to access every individual node, even in the densest clusters, while maintaining the
  beautiful clustering effect.

  Try hovering over dense cluster regions and let me know if the expansion works as expected!
