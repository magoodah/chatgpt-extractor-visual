# Constellation Visualization - Execution Plan

## Project Overview
Building a real-time prompt constellation clustering visualization that displays ChatGPT prompts as glowing nodes that cluster together based on semantic similarity using force-directed graph physics.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Structure ✅
- [x] Set up HTML structure with full-screen canvas
- [x] Create prompt data model and generator
- [x] Generate 50-100 diverse fake prompts with categories:
  - data-analysis, content-creation, coding, planning, research, communication
- [x] Mix of short prompts (1 sentence) and long prompts (3 paragraphs)
- [x] User avatars using ui-avatars.com service

### Phase 2: Semantic Clustering Algorithm ⏳
- [ ] Implement keyword extraction (remove stop words)
- [ ] Calculate similarity scoring:
  - Keyword overlap percentage
  - Prompt length similarity
  - Question type matching (how/what/why/when)
  - Technical term presence
- [ ] Group prompts with similarity score > 0.6
- [ ] Assign cluster colors from 6-8 color palette

### Phase 3: Physics Simulation System ⏳
- [ ] Create Node class with position (x,y) and velocity (vx,vy)
- [ ] Implement force calculations:
  - Attractive force between similar nodes (inverse square law)
  - Repulsive force between all nodes (prevent overlap)
  - Boundary collision detection
  - Drag coefficient (0.9) for damping
- [ ] Verlet integration for position updates
- [ ] 60 FPS animation loop with requestAnimationFrame

### Phase 4: Canvas Rendering System ⏳
- [ ] Multi-layer canvas structure:
  1. Background layer: Dark gradient + particles
  2. Cluster layer: Glowing regions around groups
  3. Connection layer: Lines between similar nodes
  4. Node layer: Avatar circles with glows
  5. UI layer: HTML overlay controls
- [ ] Implement cluster region drawing (convex hull/blob shapes)
- [ ] Node rendering with pulsing animation
- [ ] Connection lines with opacity based on similarity

### Phase 5: Interactive Features ⏳
- [ ] Mouse hover: Show prompt preview tooltip
- [ ] Node click: Highlight similar prompts
- [ ] Pan/zoom functionality
- [ ] Cluster hover: Show statistics
- [ ] Touch interactions for mobile

### Phase 6: UI Controls & Statistics ⏳
- [ ] Title overlay: "Real-Time ChatGPT Prompt Constellation"
- [ ] Stats panel (top-right):
  - Total prompts count
  - Active clusters count
  - Most active category
  - Prompts per minute
- [ ] Legend (bottom-left):
  - Cluster colors and names
  - Node age indicator
- [ ] Controls (bottom-right):
  - Play/Pause button
  - Add random prompt button
  - Reset positions button
  - Toggle connections on/off

### Phase 7: Animations & Visual Effects ⏳
- [ ] New prompt entry animation:
  - Appear at random edge (scale 0→1, opacity 0→1)
  - Move toward cluster center over 500-1000ms
  - Settle with physics
- [ ] Continuous animations:
  - Node breathing effect (scale 0.95-1.05)
  - Connection pulse (opacity 0.1-0.3)
  - Cluster glow rotation
  - Background particle drift
- [ ] Ripple effects when nodes join clusters
- [ ] Particle trails following moving nodes

### Phase 8: Performance & Polish ⏳
- [ ] Performance optimizations:
  - Off-screen canvas for static elements
  - Quadtree for collision detection
  - Limit to 100 visible nodes
  - Round positions to prevent sub-pixel rendering
- [ ] Loading animation
- [ ] Responsive design adjustments
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
