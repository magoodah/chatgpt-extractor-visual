# Constellation Visualization - Execution Plan

## Project Overview
Building a real-time prompt constellation clustering visualization that displays ChatGPT prompts as glowing nodes that cluster together based on semantic similarity using force-directed graph physics.

## Implementation Phases

  - data-analysis, content-creation, coding, planning, research, communication
- [x] Mix of short prompts (1 sentence) and long prompts (3 paragraphs)
- [x] User avatars using ui-avatars.com service

### Phase 2: Semantic Clustering Algorithm ‚è≥
- [ ] Implement keyword extraction (remove stop words)

- [ ] 60 FPS animation loop with requestAnimationFrame

### Phase 4: Canvas Rendering System ‚è≥
- [ ] Multi-layer canvas structure:
  1. Background layer: Dark gradient + particles
  2. Cluster layer: Glowing regions around groups

  4. Node layer: Avatar circles with glows
  5. UI layer: HTML overlay controls
- [ ] Implement cluster region drawing (convex hull/blob shapes)
- [ ] Node rendering with pulsing animation
- [ ] Connection lines with opacity based on similarity

### Phase 5: Interactive Features ‚è≥
- [ ] Mouse hover: Show prompt preview tooltip

### Phase 7: Animations & Visual Effects ‚è≥
- [ ] New prompt entry animation:
  - Appear at random edge (scale 0‚Üí1, opacity 0‚Üí1)
  - Move toward cluster center over 500-1000ms
  - Settle with physics
- [ ] Continuous animations:
  - Node breathing effect (scale 0.95-1.05)
  - Connection pulse (opacity 0.1-0.3)
  - Cluster glow rotation
  - Background particle drift
- [ ] Ripple effects when nodes join clusters
- [ ] Particle trails following moving nodes

### Phase 8: Performance & Polish ‚è≥
- [ ] Performance optimizations:
  - Off-screen canvas for static elements
  - Quadtree for collision detection
  - Limit to 100 visible nodes
  - Round positions to prevent sub-pixel rendering
- [ ] Loading animation
- [ ] Responsive design adjustments
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
